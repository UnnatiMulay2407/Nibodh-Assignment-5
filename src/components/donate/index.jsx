<p>Our definition of impact is to see children coming out of their shell and wanting to make a difference, being more confident, have holistic education, and grow into open-minded individuals. At Camps, we aim at making children exposed to various extra and co-curricular activities and let them discover and follow their passions. We also look forward to providing professional support to those children, who choose to continue with their passion further in life. </p>
